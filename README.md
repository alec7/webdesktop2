### What is this?
WebDesktop 2 allows you to run any web page as a desktop background on your Mac.  

### What good is this to me?
You can get nice big flip-clock or twitter feed or whatever you can think of right on your desktop using web technologies. Or you could simple load your favourite web page and have it as a background.
