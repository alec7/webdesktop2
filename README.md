### What is this?
WebDesktop 2 allows you to run any web page as a desktop background on your Mac.  

### What good is this to me?
You can get nice big flip-clock or Twitter feed or whatever you can think of be part of your desktop using web technologies. Or you could simple load your favourite web page and have it as a background.
